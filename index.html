      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a theoretical physicist specializing in statistical physics. I did my undergraduate studies at École polytechnique (X2018) and ENS Paris (ICFP, Theoretical Physics). I then completed my PhD at Sorbonne Université under the supervision of Raphaël Voituriez and Olivier Bénichou.

        My research focuses on the quantitative characterization of space exploration by random walks, with particular emphasis on the interplay between the geometry of the explored territory and the intrinsic memory, or non-Markovian behavior, of the walker. This question lies at the heart of a wide range of phenomena, from how ants explore space by following pheromone trails, to how cells migrate while actively remodeling their extracellular matrix, and how long-term memory effects may lead to the collapse of a financial index after a prolonged rise.

        I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Collège de France, working with Jean-François Joanny on problems related to active matter and out-of-equilibrium physics.

      <strong>Flips Reveal the Universal Impact of Memory on Random Explorations</strong><br>
      <em>Julien Brémont</em>, L. Régnier, A. Barbier-Chebbah, O. Bénichou, R. Voituriez<br>
      <em>Nature Communications</em> (2025)<br>
      <p>
        This article addresses a central limitation in the study of non-Markovian dynamics: in most real systems, the microscopic origin of memory is unknown or too complex to model, making it difficult to infer a reliable description of exploration dynamics. To overcome this difficulty, one must identify unifying principles governing how diverse random walks explore space, enabling model-free predictions. We introduce the <em>flip</em>, a purely geometric observable that quantifies the propensity of a process to reverse its direction of exploration—schematically, a forager turning back to exploit previously visited regions. We show that the flip probability follows a striking universal scaling law, decaying with the inverse of the size of the visited territory, largely independent of the underlying dynamics. This framework applies across a wide class of models and is validated on both biological trajectories and financial time series, providing a robust, model-free tool to quantify exploration in systems with memory.

      <strong>Persistence Exponents of Self-Interacting Random Walks</strong><br>
      <em>Julien Brémont</em>, L. Régnier, R. Voituriez, O. Bénichou<br>
      <em>Physical Review Letters</em> <strong>134</strong>, 197103 (2025)<br>
      <p>
        Persistence exponents quantify the long-time probability that a random walker avoids a given region of space, a central observable for characterizing exploration processes. Self-interacting random walks provide a minimal and physically motivated class of non-Markovian models in which the walker continuously modifies, and responds to, its own past trajectory, a mechanism relevant to systems ranging from animal foraging to migrating cells and non-reversible MCMC algorithms. In this work, we obtain the first exact determination of persistence exponents for one-dimensional self-interacting random walks. By exploiting their hidden algebraic structure, rooted in Tóth’s Ray–Knight theorems, we provide quantitative tools to detect and characterize self-interaction–induced memory effects from experimental trajectories.

      <strong>Beyond Poisson: First-Passage Asymptotics of Renewal Shot Noise</strong><br>
      <em>Julien Brémont</em><br>
      <em>arXiv:2510.21670</em> (2025)<br>
      <p>
        This paper derives the first universal asymptotic expression for first-passage times of
        renewal shot-noise processes with non-Poisson statistics. It reveals how memory encoded in
        inter-arrival times modifies the classical Arrhenius law, with direct implications for
        neuronal firing, gene expression, and other excitation–relaxation systems exhibiting
        non-Markovian dynamics.

      <strong>Exact Propagators of One-Dimensional Self-Interacting Random Walks</strong><br>
      <em>Julien Brémont</em>, O. Bénichou, R. Voituriez<br>
      <em>Physical Review Letters</em> <strong>133</strong>, 157101 (2024)<br>
      <p>
        This work provides exact expressions for the propagator of key universality classes of
        one-dimensional self-interacting random walks. It grants access to fundamental observables previously thought
        intractable and uncovers intrinsically non-Markovian mechanisms shaping spatial exploration, such as non-monotonous propagators.

      <strong>Aging Dynamics of d-Dimensional Locally Activated Random Walks</strong><br>
      <em>Julien Brémont</em>, T. Jakuszeit, R. Voituriez, O. Bénichou<br>
      <em>Physical Review E</em> <strong>110</strong>, 014604 (2024)<br>
      <p>
        This article introduces a general analytical framework for locally activated random walks, motivated by biological systems in which cells adapt their motility after traversing specific regions of their environment. In particular, it models situations where cells such as dendritic cells modify their speed or persistence after passing through confined or chemically rich zones. The theory shows how such local activation mechanisms generate strong memory effects, including aging, dynamical trapping, and non-Gaussian exploration in arbitrary dimensions, and identifies robust signatures that can be directly tested in cell migration experiments.
